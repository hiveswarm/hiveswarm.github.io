				<p>

					As a team of two teenagers with a growing passion for STEM, we hope to spread our ideas and innovations with the world. We not only hope to gain the recognition and support of others, but we also hope to make an impact on the modern-day society. We want others to be inspired by our ideas and feel compelled to do so themselves. In the future, we aim to have one of our ideas develop on a much larger scale and become a product readily available to people all around the globe.
					Garnering recognition: competitions and outreach</p>

					<p class = "subtitle">HOW DO WE PLAN TO SPREAD OUR IDEA?</p>
					<p>

						We plan to participate in competitions such as ProjectCSGIRLS and the Technovation Challenge, in hopes of gaining some recognition and maybe even tips to improve upon it. We will also be testing it out with actual beekeepers and speaking to beekeepers and professors to see if we have more to add or if they have any opinions on how effective our idea would be in the long run. So far, we have already spoken to a few, one of which was the Massachusetts Chief Apiary Inspector, who endorsed our project. She plans to let us speak at many more avenues, so that more beekeepers may be able to use our app.</p>
